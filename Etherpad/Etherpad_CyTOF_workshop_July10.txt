Some R humour: R is like cooking

Exercise:
1. Read in the "example.fcs" file
2. Extract the 'exprs' (ion counts) into a matrix
3. Remove the columns that are not of interest (i.e.,  
   (Time, Cell_length, BC1-BC7, DNA-1, DNA-2)
   alternatively, *subset* to markers that are of interest
4. Transform the data in this matrix using asinh(x/5)
5. Make a histogram of the CD3 signal across all cells
6. Make a bivariate plot of CD3 and CD4
7. From the 2739 cells, create a 2D tSNE projection 
   (input 2739 rows x ~20 columns --> output: 2739x2 matrix)
   
   library(Rtsne)
   x_tsne <- Rtsne(x, verbose=TRUE, pca=FALSE)  # 'x' is the input matrix
   x_tsne$Y       # x_tsne$Y is the 2-column output matrix 
   
8. Plot the tSNE projection (scatter plot)
9. Plot the tSNE projection with dots coloured 
   according to CD3 (scatter plot with each dot's
   colour from a colour scale)
10. Add the tSNE projection to your flowFrame/flowSet 
   object and write it out in an FCS file.
   Open the FCS file in FlowJo/Cytobank to verify that it
   worked.

(1) What you would like to get out of todayâ€™s data analysis sessions 
Hi, I would like to go into the basics of R and how to apply it to the analysis of our data

Hi, I'd like to also learn about the basics of R and how to apply it to high dimensional data
<i would like to learn the basics of R
I would like to get an idea of how I might use R to analyse my own data.
I would like to learn this software, its uses and how beneficial it could be in analysing the CyTOF data.
I would like to learn how to make beautiful plots
I would like to consolidate the things that I learned during the previous workshop.
I would like to learn how to analyse my data with R
I would appreciate to understand the basics of R, and be able to memo
rize the different basic functions; and hopefully proceed to an intermediate level.



(2) Any examples of types of data analyses (in R) that you would like to learn about 
I would like to improve my skills in R and high dimensional analysis
jow to plot multiple  parameters

Expand my workflow beyond Cytobank and Excel,

I would like to learn how to compare unknowns to a cohort of "normal" samples.
I would like to get comfortable using  R and have a basic understanding in order to analize myy own data
I would like to learn techniques to help me visualize data and compare data within a small patient population.
I would like to learn more about dimensionality reduction.
II would like to learn more about two dimensional plotting, and dataanalysis of cytof data.

I would like to learn how to use R for  analysis of Cytof and High dimensional FC data
