# Information and teaching materials for CyTOF workshop

This repository contains information and teaching materials for the R data analysis sessions in our CyTOF workshop, 13-15 March 2017, University of Zurich, Switzerland.



## Workshop information

The workshop is organized by the [Mass Cytometry Facility](http://www.cytometry.uzh.ch/en/mcf.html) at the University of Zurich, Switzerland. This is an intensive 3-day workshop aimed at introducing mass cytometry (CyTOF) experimental procedures and data analysis for users and collaborators of the Mass Cytometry Facility. Additional details are available on the [Mass Cytometry Facility website](http://www.cytometry.uzh.ch/en/mcf/training.html).

**Location:** The R data analysis sessions will be held in room [TBD], building [TBD], Irchel campus, University of Zurich. A map of the UZH Irchel campus showing the location of building [TBD] is available [here](Irchel_campus_map.png).

**Schedule:** The overall schedule for the workshop is available on the [Mass Cytometry Facility website](http://www.cytometry.uzh.ch/en/mcf/training.html). The R data analysis sessions ("Data analysis in scripted environment") will be repeated on days 1 and 2 for each group of 4-5 participants.

**Instructors:** Instructors for the R data analysis sessions are [Mark Robinson](http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/robinson.html) and [Lukas Weber](https://github.com/lmweber).



## Preparation

### System setup

If possible, please **bring your own laptop** and **install R and RStudio** before the workshop. This will ensure that you will leave the workshop with a complete data analysis system set up on your own laptop, ready to continue with your own data analysis work.

Workstations will also be available in the computer room, if this is not possible.

- **To install R**, download and run the installer for your system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/). On Windows systems, if you have separate user and administrator accounts, it is better to run the installer as administrator (right-click on .exe file and select "Run as administrator" instead of double-clicking). Otherwise problems may occur later when installing R packages.

- **To install RStudio**, download and run the "RStudio Desktop" (free version) installer for your system from the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website.

If you have previously installed R and RStudio but have not updated them in a while, please re-install the latest versions. (R installations cannot be updated easily, so it is simpler to un-install and re-install using the latest version.)


### DataCamp courses

Prior to the workshop, you will receive an email with a link to an introductory R course from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/). Please enroll and work through this course in your own time, before the workshop. The course teaches the basics of manipulating data in R. Completing the course will greatly speed up your learning process during the workshop, since you will have already seen the main R data concepts. These concepts are not intuitive, so it is very helpful to see them more than once.

After the workshop, you will also receive a link to an intermediate R course from DataCamp, where you can continue to learn more advanced R concepts, which are useful for performing more advanced data analyses.



## Schedule

The schedule for the R data analysis sessions ("Data analysis in scripted environment") will be as follows:

Overall structure: 1 day, 4x 1.5 hour blocks


| Time          | Content                            |

|               | *(short break)*                    |
| 11:00 - 12:30 | R programming                      |
|               | *(lunch break)*                    |
| 13:30 - 15:00 | Workflows and plotting             |
|               | *(short break)*                    |
| 15:30 - 17:00 | Workflows and plotting (continued) |


More details for each block, including interactive R code scripts, will be posted to this website before the workshop.



## Code of conduct

Participation in this workshop assumes acceptance of our code of conduct.

In short: please be professional and respectful at all times. We want this to be a welcoming learning environment for all. If there are any problems, please let one of the instructors know.

For a longer version, we refer to [Laurent Gatto's lab code of conduct](https://lgatto.github.io/cpu-coc/) (Computational Proteomics Unit, University of Cambridge, UK).
